# 0x19. Postmortem

<h2> Overview</h2>

Welcome to the 0x19 Postmortem project! ðŸš€

For this project, I was made to understand that in the dynamic world of software engineering, failures are inevitable.  Bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, and even the occasional hardware hiccup can bring systems to a temporary standstill. However, failure is not the endâ€”it's an opportunity to learn, improve, and prevent recurrence.

The project centers around the concept of postmortems, a crucial tool in the tech industry. Postmortems serve a dual purpose: informing the wider team about the cause of an outage and ensuring that measures are taken to prevent similar issues in the future.

<h2> Tasks</h2>

<h3>Task 0: My First Postmortem (Mandatory)</h3>

<b>Description</b>

Using one of the web stack debugging project issue or an outage you have personally face, write a postmortem. Most of you will never have faced an outage, so just get creative and invent your own :)

<b>Requirements:</b>

	- Issue Summary (that is often what executives will read) must contain:
		
		- duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone)
		
		- what was the impact (what service was down/slow? What were user experiencing? How many % of the users were affected?)

		- what was the root cause

	- Timeline (format bullet point, format: time - keep it short, 1 or 2 sentences) must contain:

		- when was the issue detected

		- how was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complainedâ€¦)

		- actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumption on the root cause of the issue)

		- misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken

		- which team/individuals was the incident escalated to

		- how the incident was resolved

		- Root cause and resolution must contain:
		
		- explain in detail what was causing the issue

		- explain in detail how the issue was fixed

	- Corrective and preventative measures must contain:

		- what are the things that can be improved/fixed (broadly speaking)

		- a list of tasks to address the issue (be very specific, like a TODO, example: patch Nginx server, add monitoring on server memoryâ€¦)

		- Be brief and straight to the point, between 400 to 600 words

<h3>1. Make people want to read your postmortem (Advanced)</h3>

<b>Description</b>

We are constantly stormed by a quantity of information, itâ€™s tough to get people to read you.

Make your post-mortem attractive by adding humour, a pretty diagram or anything that would catch your audience attention.
