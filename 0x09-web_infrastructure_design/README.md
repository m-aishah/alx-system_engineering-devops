# Web Infrastructure Design Project

## Project Overview

I completed this Web Infrastructure Design project as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The project focuses on designing and understanding various aspects of web infrastructure, covering concepts such as DNS, monitoring, web servers, load balancers, security, and scalability.

## Contents

This project consists of 4 tasks, each designed to explore different aspects of web infrastructure design. Here's a brief overview of each task and its contents:

### Task 0: Simple Web Stack

- **File**: [0-simple_web_stack](https://github.com/m-aishah/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/0-simple_web_stack)
- **Description**: In this task, we designed a one-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com. The components included a server, Nginx web server, application server, MySQL database, and DNS configuration. We explained the roles and issues associated with each component.

### Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure

- **File**: [1-distributed_web_infrastructure](https://github.com/m-aishah/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/1-distributed_web_infrastructure)
- **Description**: Task 1 involved designing a three-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com. This infrastructure included additional servers, a load balancer (HAproxy), and a MySQL database. We discussed the reasons for adding each element and explored distribution algorithms, active-active, and active-passive setups.

### Task 2: Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

- **File**: [2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure](https://github.com/m-aishah/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure)
- **Description**: Task 2 required designing a secured, encrypted, and monitored web infrastructure for www.foobar.com. We added firewalls, SSL certificates for HTTPS, and monitoring clients to enhance security and performance. The documentation explained the purpose of each element and the importance of serving traffic over HTTPS.

### Task 3: Scale Up (Advanced)

- **File**: [3-scale_up](https://github.com/m-aishah/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/3-scale_up)
- **Description**: Task 3 focused on implementing a scaled-up infrastructure with split components (web server, application server, database) and load balancers. We discussed the rationale behind each addition to improve scalability and redundancy.
