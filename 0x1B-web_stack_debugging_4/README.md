<h1>0x1B. Web stack debugging #4</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project focuses on web stack debugging and performance optimization, specifically addressing issues related to a web server setup featuring Nginx. The task involves benchmarking the server using ApacheBench to simulate HTTP requests and identifying and resolving performance issues.

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<b>0.Sky is the limit, let's bring that limit higher</b>

- Description: In this web stack debugging task, we are testing how well our web server setup featuring Nginx is doing under pressure and it turns out it’s not doing well: we are getting a huge amount of failed requests.

For the benchmarking, we are using ApacheBench which is a quite popular tool in the industry. It allows you to simulate HTTP requests to a web server. In this case, I will make 2000 requests to my server with 100 requests at a time. We can see that 943 requests failed, let’s fix our stack so that we get to 0, and remember that when something is going wrong, logs are your best friends!
