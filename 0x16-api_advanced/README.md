# 0x16. API advanced


## Overview

This project is a programming assignment focused on utilizing Python for working with APIs, specifically the Reddit API. The project aims to enhance the developer's skills in reading API documentation, handling pagination, parsing JSON responses, making recursive API calls, and sorting dictionaries. The tasks involve creating Python functions to interact with the Reddit API, such as retrieving the number of subscribers for a given subreddit, printing the titles of the top 10 posts in a subreddit, and recursively fetching all hot articles for a given subreddit. The project provides specific requirements for coding style, organization, and the use of the Requests module. The tasks are designed to reinforce fundamental concepts related to API usage and prepare the developer for potential interview questions.
